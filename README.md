# balena-logging-sensors

Three part project series that explores datalogging sensors with embedded Linux and Balena's platform.

*   Part 1 explores how to connect a sensor to an embedded Linux board and use Linux subsystems like IIO and hwmon to read data.
*   Part 2 builds on part 1 and show to deploy a TIG stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana) to store and graph sensor data on a device.
*   Part 3 builds on the previous parts to show a multi-device deployment with devices sending sensor data to a central TIG stack.
